                    <p>While the reason wasn't discussed in our books, we do know that Ryan served a number of years (completing six tours) in the Marines. His service ended in a helicopter crash in which he was severely injured.</p>

                    <h3 class="title">Ryan is recruited</h3>
                    <p>After publishing a book on the history and significance of military strategy and tactics, the CIA becomes curious in Ryan. His vast knowledge, ability to research and analyze in depth, and history of service makes him an ideal recruit for the CIA, at least in the eyes of Deputy Director of the CIA James Greer.</p>

                    <p>No longer in the Marines but once again in the service of the government, this time Ryan takes a more discreet role in international relations. He is now part of the nuclear ballet between Russia and the United States (or the West).</p>
